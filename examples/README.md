# Examples about React Intersection Observer use cases

We provides examples for three common use cases of React Intersection Observer Kit:

## 1. Animate Elements when entering the viewport

In this example, we demonstrate how to animate elements when they enter the viewport and highlight the active navigation link. The example includes styling and transition effects to enhance the user experience.

- Find the code for this example [here](./src/AnimateElements/)

## 2. Lazy Load Component

The Lazy Load Component example demonstrates how to use lazy loading for components, improving the performance by loading components only when they are about to enter the viewport.

- Find the code for this example [here](./src/LazyLoadingComponent)

## 3. Lazy Fetching Data

The Lazy Fetching Data example showcases how to fetch data lazily when the associated component is about to enter the viewport, providing an efficient way to load data on-demand.
